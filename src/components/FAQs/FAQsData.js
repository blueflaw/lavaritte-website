        q: 'Why do you call yourself \'BlueFlaw\', and what does it mean?',
        a: 'BlueFlaw is the username I chose when I first Github account. Flaw means a mark, fault, or other imperfection. All beings are flawed, but I strive to be a better version of myself than I was yesterday; I believe there is beauty in imperfection. And my favorite hue is blue.'

        q: 'Where did you learn to draw?',
        a: 'When I was four years old, I would sit down in a corner and be quiet because I\'ll be drawing something. Like a drive to be creative I guess it\'s related to the fact that when you\'re poor, you\'re trying to get out of this conundrum and trying to get out of this world and figure out what you want to do next, create some fantasies about everything else. ',
        a2: 'What helped me the most was just observing some other artists\' works, and observing anime characters I saw on TV. Growing up in the Philippines where there are limited art classes. I was not privileged enough to pay for art class, so I searched online and found some free tutorials and resources made by a kind-hearted artist. Anyone can learn how to draw for free all you need is determination :)'

        q: 'What tools, programs, or materials do you use?',
        a: 'I use a variety of mediums but I\'m most comfortable with digital art. The majority of my illustrations are done in Adobe Photoshop with a Wacom Intuos tablet. I integrated 3D programs such as Blender, Sketchup, and other procedural generation programs to help me quickly and efficiently create backgrounds and settings. That way I don\'t have to draw the same table or building over and over again. I use Adobe Premiere Pro for my video editing. ',
